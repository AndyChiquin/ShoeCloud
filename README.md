# üëü ShoeCloud ‚Äì Distributed E-commerce Platform for Sneakers

ShoeCloud is a distributed e-commerce system focused on selling two types of sneakers: **sports (football)** and **urban (lifestyle)**. The project aims to implement a scalable and robust microservices architecture, integrating multiple technologies, databases, architectural styles, observability tools, security features, and DevOps automation.

## üåê Key Features

- üß© **30 microservices** grouped by business domain
- üß† **5 backend languages** (Python, Go, Node.js, Java, PHP)
- üì± **Cross-platform frontend**: Web, Mobile, and Desktop
- üîó **5 architecture styles**: REST, SOAP, WebSocket, Webhook, gRPC
- üóÉÔ∏è **7 databases** from 3 different types: Relational, NoSQL, and Key-Value
- üìä **Full observability** with Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and Site24x7
- üîí **Advanced security** with JWT, CORS, and Bastion Host (Jump Box)
- üîÅ **Event-Driven Architecture** for reactive communication
- üõ†Ô∏è **DevOps CI/CD** with GitHub Actions, DockerHub, and EC2 deployment

## üß© Business Domains

- **User Domain**: Authentication, roles, sessions, profiles, password recovery
- **Product Domain**: Catalog, categories, search, images, pricing, inventory
- **Order Domain**: Shopping cart, orders, invoices, refunds

---

## üöÄ Deployment

Each domain is deployed in a **separate EC2 instance**. The system uses:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** per microservice
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **API Gateway and Load Balancer** as entry layer

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- üîë JWT tokens in all microservices
- üîê Role-based access control
- üõ°Ô∏è Bastion Host (Jump Box) for secure access
- ‚úÖ Cross-service validation and authentication
